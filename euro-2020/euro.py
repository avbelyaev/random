# Example:
# Final result of the game: 1-0 (after 90 or 120 min)
# - you voted 1-0 -> 3 points [exact-score + diff + outcome]
# - you voted 2-1 -> 2 points [diff + outcome]

#
# ⚠️ Playoff rules ⚠️
# You may additionally vote for the winner-by-penalty in case of a draw

# Example:
# Final result of the whole game (120 min): 1-1, team-B has won by penalties
# - you voted 1-1 B -> 4 points [exact-score + diff + outcome(B won) + winner-by-penalty]
# - you voted 0-0 B -> 3 points [diff + outcome(B won) + winner-by-penalty]

# - you voted 1-1 A -> 2 points [exact-sore + diff]
# - you voted 0-0 A -> 1 point [diff]
